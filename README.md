<h1>Contrast, Brightness and Saturation Enhancement on Color Images</h1>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>This project presents the three important image processing techniques:
Contrast Enhancement, Brightness Enhancement and Saturation Enhancement. The primary 
objective is to analyze the effectiveness and applications of these methods in image 
enhancement and manipulation. <br/>
Contrast enhancement is a vital image processing technique aimed at improving 
visual quality by emphasizing the differences between pixel intensities in an image. This 
brief overview presents various methods employed for contrast enhancement, such as 
histogram equalization, adaptive contrast stretching, and gamma correction. The 
significance of contrast enhancement lies in its ability to enhance image details, mitigate 
noise, and optimize image analysis in diverse applications, including medical imaging, 
remote sensing, and computer vision.<br/>
Brightness enhancement is a fundamental image processing technique designed to 
augment the overall luminance of an image, leading to improved visibility and visual 
perception. This concise introduction explores different methodologies for brightness 
enhancement, including histogram modification, logarithmic transformation, and adaptive 
techniques. The significance of brightness enhancement lies in its capability to enhance 
underexposed regions, reveal hidden details, and optimize image analysis across numerous 
domains, such as surveillance, photography, and satellite imagery. <br/>
Saturation enhancement is a pivotal image processing technique focused on 
amplifying the intensity of colors within an image, thereby enriching its visual appearance 
and increasing its perceived vibrancy. This succinct introduction delves into diverse methods 
utilized for saturation enhancement, including color space transformations, histogram 
equalization, and contrast-based techniques. The significance of saturation enhancement lies 
in its ability to intensify colors, improve image aesthetics, and augment the visual impact of 
multimedia content in fields like advertising, digital art, and web design.</p>
